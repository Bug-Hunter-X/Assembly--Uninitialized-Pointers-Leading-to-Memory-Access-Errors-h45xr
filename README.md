This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in assembly programming: memory access issues caused by uninitialized or invalid pointers.  The `bug.asm` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version. The error arises from accessing memory locations using `ebx` and `esi` without ensuring they point to valid, initialized data. This can lead to program crashes or unpredictable results. The solution focuses on proper pointer initialization and validation before dereferencing them.
